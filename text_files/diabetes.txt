## User Inputs for Diabetes Prediction
To make predictions regarding diabetes, we require the following inputs from the user:

1. **Glucose Level**: 
   - The blood glucose level of the individual, measured in mg/dL.
   - High levels may indicate diabetes.
2. **Blood Pressure**:
   - The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, measured in mmHg.
   - Hypertension can increase the risk of diabetes.

3. **Skin Thickness**: 
   - The thickness of the skin at the tricep, measured in mm.
   - This measurement can indicate insulin resistance.

4. **Insulin Level**: 
   - The amount of insulin in the blood, measured in ÂµU/mL.
   - High insulin levels can suggest insulin resistance.

5. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: 
   - A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
   - A BMI over 25 is considered overweight, which increases diabetes risk.

6. **Age**: 
   - The age of the user in years.
   - Risk of diabetes increases with age.

7. **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: 
   - A score that indicates the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
   - A higher score reflects a greater genetic predisposition.
