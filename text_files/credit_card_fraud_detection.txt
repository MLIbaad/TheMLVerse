**PCA Transformation in Fraud Detection**

The input data represents features transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique crucial for:

- Anonymizing sensitive transaction details
- Reducing computational complexity
- Extracting most significant transaction characteristics
- Mitigating potential bias and overfitting
- Enabling more efficient machine learning modeling

Key inputs include:
- Original transaction time
- 28 PCA-transformed features (V1-V28)
- Transaction amount

PCA converts original features into uncorrelated principal components, capturing maximum variance with minimal information loss.
