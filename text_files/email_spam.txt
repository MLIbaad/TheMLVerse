#Email Spam Classification System - Instructions
---
Welcome to the Email Spam Classification Application! This system will help you classify emails as either Spam or Not Spam.

To test the system, you can enter an example of a spam email. For instance, you can use the following example:

-"XXXMobileMovieClub: To use your credit, click the WAP link in the next txt message or click here>> http://wap.xxxmobilemovieclub.com?n=QJKGIGHJJGCBL"

Just copy and paste the text into the input area and click "Process" to see if the email is classified as spam or not.

Enjoy using the application!
