## User Inputs for Heart Disease Prediction
To make predictions regarding diabetes, we require the following inputs from the user:

1. **Age:**
   - The age of the individual in years.
   - Risk of heart disease generally increases with age.

2. **Sex:**
   - The gender of the individual (male or female).
   - Gender can influence heart disease risk factors.

3. **Chest Pain Type:**
   - Type of chest pain experienced (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain).
   - Different types of chest pain can indicate varying levels of heart disease risk.

4. **Resting Blood Pressure:**
   - The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, measured in mmHg.
   - Hypertension is a significant risk factor for heart disease.

5. **Serum Cholesterol:**
   - Total cholesterol levels in mg/dL.
   - High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart disease.

6. **Fasting Blood Sugar:**
   - Blood sugar levels measured in mg/dL.
   - A fasting blood sugar level greater than 126 mg/dL may indicate diabetes.

7. **Resting Electrocardiographic Results:**
   - The results of an electrocardiogram at rest (normal, having ST-T wave abnormality, showing left ventricular hypertrophy).
   - Abnormal results can indicate heart issues.

8. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved:**
   - The maximum heart rate during exercise, measured in beats per minute.
   - Low maximum heart rate may indicate poor cardiovascular health.

9. **Exercise Induced Angina:**
   - Whether exercise induces angina (yes or no).
   - Exercise-induced angina may indicate underlying heart disease.

10. **Oldpeak:**
    - The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
    - Higher values may suggest heart problems.

11. **Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment:**
    - The slope of the ST segment during peak exercise (upsloping, flat, or downsloping).
    - The slope can provide insights into heart health.

12. **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy:**
    - The number of major vessels (0-3) that are colored by fluoroscopy.
    - More colored vessels indicate better heart health.

13. **Thalassemia:**
    - The result of the thalassemia test (normal, fixed defect, or reversible defect).
    - Abnormal results can indicate heart disease.
