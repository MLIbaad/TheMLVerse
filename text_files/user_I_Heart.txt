**This is a predictive model; a doctor's opinion holds significantly more power.**
It is essential to consult healthcare professionals for a thorough assessment and diagnosis.

## User Inputs for Diabetes Prediction
To make predictions regarding Heart Disease, we require the following inputs from the user:

1.**Age**:
  -The age of the individual in years.
  -Risk of heart disease generally increases with age.

2.**Sex**:
  -The gender of the individual (typically coded as 1 for male, 0 for female).
  -Men are generally at higher risk of heart disease than women.

3.**Chest Pain Type (cp)**:
  -The type of chest pain experienced, usually categorized into four types:
    0: Typical angina
    1: Atypical angina
    2: Non-anginal pain
    3: Asymptomatic
   Different types of chest pain can indicate different levels of heart disease risk.

4.**Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)**:
   -The person's resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
   -High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease.

5.**Serum Cholesterol (chol)**:
   -The serum cholesterol level in mg/dL.
   -High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart disease.

6.**Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)**:

   -Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = true; 0 = false)
   -High blood sugar levels can indicate diabetes, a risk factor for heart disease.

7.**Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)**:
    -Resting ECG results, typically coded as:
      0: Normal
      1: Having ST-T wave abnormality
      2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
    Abnormal ECG results can indicate heart problems.

8.**Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**:
    -The maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
    -Can indicate cardiovascular fitness and heart health.

9.**Exercise Induced Angina (exang)*:
    -Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
    -Chest pain during exercise can be a sign of heart disease.

10.**ST Depression (oldpeak)**:
    -ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
    -Abnormal values can indicate heart problems.

11.**Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)**:
    -The slope of the peak exercise ST segment, often categorized as:
        0: Upsloping
        1: Flat
        2: Downsloping
    The shape of this segment can indicate heart issues.

12.**Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)**:
    -Number of major blood vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
    -More colored vessels can indicate more severe heart disease.

13.**Thalassemia (thal)**:
    -A blood disorder, often categorized as:
        0: Normal
        1: Fixed defect
        2: Reversible defect
    Certain types of thalassemia can affect heart health.



These inputs provide a comprehensive set of factors that can be used to assess an individual's risk of heart disease.
