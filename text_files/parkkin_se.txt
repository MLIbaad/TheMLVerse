## User Inputs for Parkinson's Prediction
To make predictions regarding diabetes, we require the following inputs from the user:

***MDVP:Fo(Hz)*** - Average vocal fundamental frequency

***MDVP:Fhi(Hz)*** - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency

***MDVP:Flo(Hz)*** - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency

***MDVP:Jitter(%) , MDVP:Jitter(Abs) , MDVP:RAP , MDVP:PPQ , Jitter:DDP*** - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency

***MDVP:Shimmer , MDVP:Shimmer(dB) , Shimmer:APQ3 , Shimmer:APQ5 , MDVP:APQ , Shimmer:DDA*** - Several measures of variation in amplitude

***NHR , HNR*** - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice

***RPDE , D2*** - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures

***DFA*** - Signal fractal scaling exponent

***spread1 , spread2 , PPEMDVP:Fo(Hz)*** - Average vocal fundamental frequency
