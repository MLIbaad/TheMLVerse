# Throughout this project, I have used high-quality HD images to enhance the user experience.

Visuals play a crucial role in making content more engaging and informative, and I wanted to

ensure that the images used were of the best quality available.

To maintain transparency and give proper credit, I have compiled a list of all the sources

from which these images were taken. If you're interested in checking out these sources,

you can find them here:

### I appreciate the effort of photographers and content creators who make such resources available, and this section serves as a small gesture of acknowledgment towards them.
